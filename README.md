# fanuc-sim
The repository demonstrates the the kinematic control of 6 axis manipulator on a 3D model of the Fanuc robot in Unity. The control system is made in Matlab with the help of the robotic toolbox, and it is connected with unity by the TCP server. The repository has two scenes: one with the generic pick and place, and the other with pick and place based on color of the cube. The control is performed by Matlab scripts main.m and main_colors.m.
